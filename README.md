## Utilization of Assembly Language  

The **Maths Quiz Master** demonstrates the application of low-level programming by utilizing:  

- **Registers** for data manipulation and processing.  
- **Interrupts** for screen display and input/output handling.  
- **Stack Operations** to store and retrieve values during program execution.  
- **Looping Constructs** for repetitive tasks like question generation and score calculation.  

This project exemplifies how the 8086 microprocessor's architecture and assembly language can be utilized to create a functional educational application.
